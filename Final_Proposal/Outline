For my final project I would like to make a tree with fruit hanging off of it. The fruit will grow in size rapidly before falling
off the tree onto the ground. I will render the fruits with textures and possibly have multiple fruits as well. 
I intend to have the fruit fall into a bucket on the ground which will then be carried by a conveyor belt until it is offscreen.
As a stretch goal I would like to have falling leaves as well and possibly other gameplay features.

Week 1: I will start by finding models for the fruit as well as the tree/leaves and the accompanying images.

Week 2: I will complete the code to render the fruit and possibly the tree as well.

Week 3: Begin working on the scale and translation aspects of the fruit growing and falling once at a certain size.

Week 4: Work on the rotation of the rolling fruit

Week 5: Finish up extraneous work and possibly work on the stretch goal.

I will be using THREE.js and any other helpful libraries I might need. This will be web based but will not require user input. 

Scott Thompson and I will be working together to make this into a game where the user clicks on fruit of appropriate ripeness 
to earn points. The higher the score the better and the closer a fruit is to being perfectly ripe will increase the score the player gets.
Please let us know if you believe this would be an acceptable project for a pair of people. Thank you.
